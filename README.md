# Project Title: Real Estate Care

### Description
This prototype is a made for a fictitious real estate company. Its purpose is to help property inspectors document 
property inspections. This project is build with [Ionic/Vue](https://ionicframework.com/docs/vue/overview).

## Install project
```sh
npm install
```

## Start App
```sh
ionic serve
```

## Demo user account
Two demo accounts were made for testing purposes.
- Username: user
- Password: 123
  <br/>--
- Username: Luisa
- Password: abc

The 2-factor authentication code is always: 123456

## State Management
State Management is done with [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/).

## Typescript disabled
This project was build with plain JS.

## Ionic CLI is needed
```sh
npm install -g @ionic/cli@latest
```

## HTTP Client
Uses [axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) for api calls. (installed with "npm install")
```sh
npm install axios
```

## CSS Pre-processor
This app uses sass. (Installed with "npm install")
```sh
npm install -D sass
```

## Vue PDF renderer.
Uses [vue-pdf-embed](https://github.com/hrynko/vue-pdf-embed) to render pdf files and pdf objects. (Installed with "npm install")
```sh
npm install -d vue-pdf-embed
```

## Dummy data
- Data db: <br/>Uses [RealEstateCareJSON](https://json-real-estate-care-3167f11da290.herokuapp.com/) for dummy data. 
It's my private [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) JSON server. [GitHub](https://github.com/BabyLizzy-FunTime-Lab/JsonRealEstateCare)
- Media: <br/>Images and PDF's are stored and fetched as Base64 encoded strings, on and from 
[RealEstateCareJSON](https://json-real-estate-care-3167f11da290.herokuapp.com/). Some of the demo media is served from my [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) account.

## 2-Factor Authentication and login are simulated
At login one must input a simple code to simulate a 2Way Authentication. 
The input code and the dummy code provided by the JSON server are compared in the LoginStore. 
This check would normally take place on the server and the secret code would be generated by a third party service and 
fetched on the server. The login action is also executed on the client side. This is a security problem. Unfortunately
my JSON server isn't capable of running these checks. But a proper server could. This will be fixed in future versions 
of the app.

## Security 
The app prevents code injection by sanitizing inputs values with the sanitizer.js service. However, this is only done 
client side. Ideally inputs should also be sanitized at server side. Unfortunately, my JSON server isn't capable of 
running these kinds of operations.<br/> 
Security issues related to routing and database operations will also be addressed when using a proper server that is
capable of more complex operations. 

## Usability
[Wave](https://wave.webaim.org/) was used to check for major errors in web content accessibility. The RealEstateCare
app triggers no major errors nor alerts. However, there is room for improvement in the structural elements. The WCAG
guidelines are organized around four core principles, often summarized as POUR (Perceivable, Operable, 
Understandable, and Robust). More points of improvement where found after assessing the app on these principles. 
For example, highlighting focus points properly when navigating the app with the TAB button.<br/>
Any further improvements in usability will be added in the next version of the RealEstateCare app.

## Web-design Principals
The 10 guidelines of 
[Jakob Nielsen](https://www.cursuswp.com/10-heuristieken-jakob-nielsen-webdesign-principes-regels-vuistregels-webdesign/)
where followed to provide a positive user experience. The RealEstateCare app provides feedback to the user based on
actions taken and it also provides convenient context sensitive actions. This includes "back buttons", an "undo changes 
button" when updating data and dynamically generated success and fail alerts. I also gave special attention to providing 
the user with a familiar experience and to consistency in style and views.

## Style guides and best practices Ionic & Vue.js
I endeavoured to follow the style guides and best practices of both Ionic and Vue.js as closely as possible.
Close attention was given to naming conventions and coding conventions. I also stuck to the theming style of ionic
by altering the css without changing the structure. I also used the style guides provided by Vue.js. 
Any changes made to the style where made in scoped scss and using custom names for the modified elements.

## Missing features
These features were not completed because they lay outside the parameters of the assigment. However, they wil be 
included in future versions of the RealEstateCare app.
- Notification bell button: <br/> The nav bar has a notification bell. Its purpose is to alert the user of actions that 
haven't yet been taken. For example, saving new inspection data. 
- Navbar Settings button & Settings home view tile button: <br/> The settings buttons on the nav-bar and home view lead 
to a settings view but the settings are not operational.
- Footer search button: <br/> The footer includes a search button. The search button leads to the "completed tasks" view
but it does not provide a search function. 

## Error notes
- Blocked aria-hidden:<br/> 
This error appears to originate from the datepicker npm package used in this app. I haven't used the aria-hidden
attribute in this application.
- PDF encoding issues:<br/>
Under the modifications part of an inspection, it is possible to save and view a pdf. I am getting 
warnings in the console regarding this process. The component works, but needs more work to resolve
these issues.
